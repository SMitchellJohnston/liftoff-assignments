### Overview
Born from a need for a localized place to find information on cities, Piri is for people who are looking for a change of scenery but want to make the right decision on where to make their next move. Piri lets people view stats about cities such as safety & security ratings, employment prospects, local education, and more in order to help you make an informed decision. See reviews from and connect with real people living in the area, and create lists and compare different locations to make your move the best one.
